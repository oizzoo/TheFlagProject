# 🇱🇦 The Flag Project – CSS Laos Flag

This is a small practice project where I recreated the national flag of **Laos** using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without any images or JavaScript.

The goal of this mini-project was to get more comfortable working with:
- CSS positioning
- Flexbox and layout techniques
- Shape creation with `border-radius`, `background`, and other basic CSS properties

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to build visual elements purely with CSS
- How to structure simple layouts without external assets
- How to represent real-world visuals (like flags) using code
